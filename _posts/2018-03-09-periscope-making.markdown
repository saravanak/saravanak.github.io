## The idea
I've been thinking about constructing a periscope - the DIY way. 

So, oneday I bought 2 3"x3" mirrors for under half a dollar. (Rs. 20). I needed to design a cardboard cutout, then fold it correctly to form the shape of the periscope. 

After some trials and references lookups on the net, I arrived at this.

I am leaving out a lot of other details as to how to fold and other step-by-step instructions - as it would spoil the thrill of making something new. 

So I ended up with a modular design of the periscope and I feel happy about how it turned out. This design can be extended to make the periscope taller, make the periscope look at what's behind - by making a `C` shaped periscope!

Happy making!
